# about me

My name is Chukwuemeka Emmanuel Mordi, just Mordi is good. I'm currently a Junior in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. I’m also an undergraduate researcher at the [QT3 Lab](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/qt3-lab/home) working on developing software for hyperspectral imaging on a quantum light microscope alongside my advisors [Max Parsons](https://people.ece.uw.edu/parsons_max/) and [Kai-Mei Fu](https://phys.washington.edu/people/kai-mei-fu). Later this year I'll be working at Amazon as a Software Engineering Intern mainly focused on business data and intelligence.

# research

 - [Quantum Light Microscope](https://github.com/qt3uw) - Developing software to enable hyperspectral imaging on a quantum light microscope. Which is a confocal microscope designed for the analysis of light from single quantum emitters at room temperature, such as spin-defects in materials and quantum dots.

# projects

 - [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/cmordi/caesar_cipher) - Tool I built to help brute force Caesar Ciphers because I got bored. Could be used in CTFs (maybe I’ll compete in a few months. research is my main focus right now tbh).

 - [Monkeypox](https://github.com/cmordi/monkeypox) - Some exploratory data analysis on the monkeypox outbreak. My summer was dull so I wanted to refine my data science "skills" lmao.

 - [Housing Pipeline](https://github.com/cmordi/redfin-pipeline) -
    Attempted this because I wanted to learn about the implementation of ML models and predictive analysis. It's still in progress.
