# About

My name is Chukwuemeka Emmanuel Mordi, just Mordi is good. I'm currently a Junior in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. I’m also an undergraduate researcher at the [QT3 Lab](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/qt3-lab/home) working on developing software for hyperspectral imaging on a quantum light microscope alongside my advisors [Max Parsons](https://people.ece.uw.edu/parsons_max/) and [Kai-Mei Fu](https://phys.washington.edu/people/kai-mei-fu). Later this year I'll be working at Amazon as a Software Engineering Intern mainly focused on business data and intelligence. I have plans of going to grad school so I guess we'll see how that goes...

# Research

 - [Quantum Light Microscope](https://github.com/qt3uw) - Developing software to enable hyperspectral imaging on a quantum light microscope. 

# Some Projects

 - [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/cmordi/caesar_cipher) - Tool I built to help brute force Caesar Ciphers because I got bored. Could be used in CTFs (maybe I’ll compete in a few months. research is my main focus right now tbh).

 - [Monkeypox](https://github.com/cmordi/monkeypox) - Some exploratory data analysis on the monkeypox outbreak. My summer was dull so I wanted to refine my data science "skills" lmao.

 - [Housing Pipeline](https://github.com/cmordi/redfin-pipeline) -
    Did this because I wanted to learn about the implementation of ML models and predictive analysis. All this project did was just make me more ML skeptic, I'll talk about that another time. It's still in progress but it needs to be put up here since it taught me a very important lesson.

# Resources

 - [Info on research](https://www.quantumx.washington.edu/research/) - This may change but for now my research interests lie in the realm of developing software that aids quantum computing systems.
  
Note: I will update the resources section at a later stage with guess what, more resources!
