# About

My name is Chukwuemeka Emmanuel Mordi, but Mordi is good. I'm currently a Junior in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate researcher at the [QT3 Lab](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/qt3-lab/home) working on developing software for hyperspectral imaging on a quantum light microscope alongside my advisers [Dr. Max Parsons](https://people.ece.uw.edu/parsons_max/) and [Prof. Kai-Mei Fu](https://phys.washington.edu/people/kai-mei-fu). This summer i'll be interning at Amazon as a Software Engineering intern mainly focused on business data and intelligence. I have plans of going to grad school so I guess we'll see how that goes...

# Research

 - [Quantum Light Processor](https://github.com/qt3uw) - a program to enable hyperspectral imaging on a quantum light microscope. 

# Some Projects

 - [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/cmordi/caesar_cipher) - tool i built to help brute force caesar ciphers bc i got bored. could use in ctf's (no, i dont really participate in ctf's, maybe in a few months)

 - [Monkeypox](https://github.com/cmordi/monkeypox) - some exploratory data analysis i attempted to do on the monkeypox outbreak. got bored so i wanted to flex my data science skills

 - [housing data pipeline](https://github.com/cmordi/redfin-pipeline) -
    i did not attempt this one bc i was bored. just wanted simply curious and wanted to learn abou ML models. project still isnt finished but i'm more focused on making sure i understand the concepts

# Resources

 - [Info on reserach interests](https://www.quantumx.washington.edu/research/) - this might change but right now i would say that my research interests currently lie in the realm of developing tools that will aid in the process of quantum computing. the link can hopefully provide more info on all things quantum at my school 
  
Note: I will update the resources section at a later stage with guess what, more resources!
