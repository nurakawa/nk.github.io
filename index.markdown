# about 

My name is Nura Kawa, and I am a Research Scientist at [neurocat](https://neurocat.ai), a startup based in Berlin, Germany.
	
My research interests are in Robustness and Explainability of AI. I would like to explore methods that enable the development of AI applications that are highly functional, but also reliable and responsible. At neurocat I currently develop methods for assessing the robustness of AI models used in autonomous vehicles. 
 

Previously I completed an MSc in Statistics _magna cum laude_ from KU Leuven (Belgium), during which I wrote my [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/nurakawa/localized-classmap/blob/main/msc_thesis_kawa.pdf) on a new method for Explainable AI. During my studies I was fortunate to be funded by the [Science@Leuven Scholarship](https://wet.kuleuven.be/english/scienceatleuvenscholarship). I also have a BA in Statistics from UC Berkeley (USA), where I worked as a [URAP](https://research.berkeley.edu/urap/) student on research in Bayesian Statistics applied to Hydrogeology.

# projects

- [BerDiBa (Berlin Digital Rail Operations)](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai/projects/berdiba.html) BerDiBa aims to implement a holistic digital twin for rail operations using innovative signal processing methods and Artificial Intelligence. My work focuses on methods for robustness assessment of AI modules in autonomous railway systems. 

- [Security of AI Systems](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Service-Navi/Publikationen/Studien/Projekt_P464/Projekt_P464_node.html) An in-depth study on the security risks of transfer learning, including backdoor and adversarial attacks; in collaboration with the German Federal Office of Information Security [(BSI)](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Service-Navi/Publikationen/Studien/Projekt_P464/Projekt_P464_node.html)

- [Localized Classmaps](https://github.com/nurakawa/localized-classmap) A new Explainable AI method that enables an interpretation of the outputs of classification algorithms.
