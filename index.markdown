My name is Nura Kawa. I am currently a Research Scientist at [neurocat](https://neurocat.ai), a startup that delivers innovation in AI testing and validation. I am based in Berlin, Germany. 

At neurocat my research focuses on evaluating the robustness of AI models, especially for perception models used in autonomous vehicles. I also work on methods and applications of Explainable AI. My goal is to contribute to efforts towards the development of AI applications that are highly functional, but also reliable and responsible. 
	
 
Previously I obtained an MSc in Statistics _magna cum laude_ from KU Leuven (Belgium), where I was fortunate to be funded by the [Science@Leuven Scholarship](https://wet.kuleuven.be/english/scienceatleuvenscholarship), and where I wrote my [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/nurakawa/localized-classmap/blob/main/msc_thesis_kawa.pdf) on a new Explainable AI method. I also have a BA in Statistics from UC Berkeley (USA), where, as part of the [URAP](https://research.berkeley.edu/urap/) program, I worked on statistical methods in Hydrogeology.
