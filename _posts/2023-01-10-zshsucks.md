It's been about a week since the winter quarter started. The campus and hallways are full but in this weather i'll give it a week until the "new year, new me" euphoria starts to wear off and class attendance drops swiftly.
 
#### First week ratings
 
 Signal Processing I. Naturally I was late. The professor is what you would call a "universally great" teacher, but hovering around a 7/10 when it comes to the (dad) jokes.
 
This quarter I'm taking a DSA class. No more prepping for technical interviews just off intuition and neetcode videos. I was kinda excited about the class before school started but it's been pretty slow paced so far. Hopefully, it picks up a bit. I'll give the professor a 6.5/10 mainly based off his "hey iâ€™m a surfer dude" sandals that he wore on the first day.
 
Lastly, my C programming class. This class is completely dissimilar to my DSA class, things are moving so fast that I'm already lost. It doesn't help that my Zsh shell has completely given up on me. At this point I'm convinced that my relationship with Zsh must come to an end. Oh well, time for Bash :)
