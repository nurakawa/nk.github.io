It's been about a week since the winter quarter started. The campus and hallways are full but in this weather i'll give it one more week until the "new year, new me" euphoria starts to wear off and class attendance drops swiftly.
 
#### First week ratings
 
Got ready and went to my first class, Signal Processing I. Naturally I was late. The Professor is definitely one of my top Professors of all time when it comes to teaching capability, hovering around an 8/10 when it comes to the (dad) jokes.
 
This quarter I'm taking a DSA class. No more preparing for technical interviews just off intuition and neetcode videos. I was kinda excited about the class before school started but it's been pretty slow paced so far. Hopefully, my professor can pick up the pace a bit. i'll give him a 6.5/10 mainly based on his "hey iâ€™m a surfer dude" sandals he wore on the first day.
 
Lastly, my C programming class. This class is completely dissimilar to my DSA class, things are moving so fast that I'm already lost. It doesn't help that my Zsh shell has completely given up on me. At this point I'm convinced that my relationship with Zsh must come to an end. Oh well, time for Bash :)
