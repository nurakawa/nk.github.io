### The world in 2020
It goes without saying that 2020 has been characteristically marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the primary tools that policymakers across the world have chosen to curb the spread of Covid-19 is to impose restriction on mobility. For those of us in Europe, we can take a calendar view of how our time spent at home, at work, and outdoors has changed as a result of national policies. 

<br><br>

The calendar heatmap shows, for a selected nation and mobility category, the daily percent change in mobility compared to a baseline value (more information in the "Data" section). The linear calendar shows the start and end dates of the selected nation's Covid-19 response measures.

### Some Insights

- Finland, Estonia, Sweden and Norway had comparatively few Covid Response Measures compared to Belgium, France, Greece and Italy; yet, all countries have relatively similar residential mobility patterns. Sweden, despite its laissez-faire Covid-19 response, shows a strong decrease in mobility in workplaces and transit stations.
- People walked and drove less during times of Covid restrictions. Time spent in parks increases dramatically in the summer for nearly all countries, likely due to warmer weather.
- In several countries - notably Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, people spent more time at home on weekdays, even when stay-at-home response measures were temporarily lifted.

### The Data

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Google has provided [open-source Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) to "provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19." Starting from February 6, 2020, the data show for each day how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline. 

__The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3â€“Feb 6, 2020.__ 

The data can also be downloaded directly from [Our World in Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ActiveConclusion/COVID19_mobility/master/summary_reports/summary_report_countries.csv).

<br>
Data on Covid-19 response measures comes from the European Center for Disease Control and can be found [here]("https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-data-response-measures-covid-19) along with a Data Dictionary that explains the specifics of non-pharmaceutical response measures. The data is updated frequently - this visualization uses the June 10, 2021 version.

### Please Note: Interpreting the Data

Google's Mobility data is relative to a baseline. Therefore, it's not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations that naturally occur (for instance, people spend more time in parks when the weather is warmer, pandemic or not). The Covid-19 response measures included in the linear calendar are only a select few of the response measures taken. Therefore, they do not accurately represent all nations' responses; some nations relied more heavily on partial measures and/or regional measures.
