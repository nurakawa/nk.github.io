I received a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from __UC Berkeley__ and a Master’s degree from __KU Leuven__. During my studies, I developed an interest in Machine Learning, especially in reliability aspects such as explainabilty, privacy, and robustness. I explored those topics through my work as an AI Research Scientist at [neurocat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17311) and my master’s thesis on a [novel XAI method for classifiers](https://github.com/nurakawa/localized-classmap). 

In my free time, I like to read - here's what's on my [bookshelf](https://nuras-notes.notion.site/13d875c7c3b5803bb4b6c0aca39b0720?v=13d875c7c3b581519374000c4a24d443&pvs=74).
