Some info about what I’ve done in college. The hyperlinks may take you to outdated iterations of the course but it’s just to provide an example of the course material.

(this only contains my junior year courses since my first two years of college weren’t too interesting. everything here is just my opinion, don’t be mad)

__Fall 2022__

 - [Intro to Database Systems](https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/cse414-22au) -
    straightforward class. the professor was passionate about the work, weekly assignments weren't difficult. the final was even easier

 - [Digital Circuits And Systems](https://class.ece.uw.edu/271/hauck2/) -
    hardest class I’ve ever taken. be prepared to grind out hundreds of lines of system verilog code every other day. harsh grading

 - [Inclusive Design and Engineering](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/HCDE315) -
    felt like the professor veered off the central principle of the class more than a few times. the work was often tedious but nothing too mind-numbing. had to take it to satisfy a requirement so it is what it is

 - [Programming for Signal and Information Processing](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/E%20E241) -
    lab based class. wish I attended more lectures. we sped through a lot of topics (I already knew them so I wasn't bothered). the homework was moderately difficult so I appreciated the professor's attempt to make the class challenging 

__Winter 2023__

 - Data Structures and Algorithms 

 - Intermediate Programming Concepts and Tools

 - Signal Processing I

 - Computer Hardware Skills
