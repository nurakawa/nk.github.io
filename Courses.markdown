Some info about what i've done in college. The hyperlinks may take you to outdated iterations of the course but it's just to provide an example on the course material.

(this only contains my junior year courses since my first two years of college wasn't too interesting. everything here is just my opinion, don't be mad)

Fall 2022

 - [Intro to Database Systems](https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/cse414-22au) -
    straight forward class. the professor was passionate about the work, weekly assignments weren't difficult. the final was even easier

 - [Digital Circuits And Systems](https://class.ece.uw.edu/271/hauck2/) -
    hardest class i've ever taken in college. be prepared to grind out 100's of lines of system verilog code every other day. really harsh grading

 - [Inclusive Design and Engineering](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/HCDE315) -
    the class was ok. felt like the professor veered off the path of main point of the class a few times. the work was often tedious but nothing too mind numbing. had to take it to satisfy a requirement so it is what it is

 - [Programming for Signal and Information Processing](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/E%20E241) -
    lab based class. wish i attended more lectures. we sped through a lot of topics (i already knew them so i wasn't bothered). the homework was moderately difficult so i appreciated the professor's attempt to make the class challenging 

Winter 2023

 - Data Structures and Algorithms 

 - Intermediate Programming Concepts and Tools

 - Signal Processing I

 - Computer Hardware Skills
